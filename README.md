# Example of a Final Project repo at GitHub

The final project repo on GitHub will be updated several times. It is essential that you manage your files carefully, because your grade will depend on what you publish and sync on GitHub.

As always, you will create a *gh-pages* branch and work inside that branch. When you commit and sync, you are in that *gh-pages* branch. Be careful not to change the branch, or you will not be sync'ing the correct files.

This README.md file is a simple text file created in Atom. The *.md* extension indicates it is written in **Markdown.** See the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](http://support.mashery.com/docs/read/customizing_your_portal/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet) to find out how to write documents with Markdown. For more information, see the [Wikipedia article about Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

## The format of your README.md file

This is where you will tell me what you did or did not do each week. This writeup counts toward your grade. I want you to evaluate what you accomplished, why you did not complete what you said you would (if that is the case), what snags you hit, what you are pleased about. This writeup should be at least 50 words each week. It can be as long as you need it to be.

Do not delete any of the writeup from previous weeks. This will be a record of your project.

## Week 1

What you did, what you didn't do, etc. Include links to any libraries or tutorials you used. **Example:** I used this [horizontal timeline](https://codyhouse.co/demo/horizontal-timeline/index.html) from CodyHouse. (Minimum: 50 words.)

## Week 2

What you did, what you didn't do, etc. Include links to any libraries or tutorials you used. (Minimum: 50 words.)

## Week 3

What you did, what you didn't do, etc. Include links to any libraries or tutorials you used. (Minimum: 50 words.)

## Final summary of my project

Your thoughts about the process of working on this project. (Minimum: 100 words.)
